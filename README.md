## üëã Introduction:

The Mobile Spare Parts Management System (MSPMS) is a versatile and robust desktop application 
tailored to streamline the management of spare parts inventory, user roles, and business transactions. 
Built with Python as the core programming language, SPMS integrates seamlessly with both local (SQLite) 
and online (MySQL) databases, ensuring flexibility and scalability for businesses of varying sizes. 
The system provides role-based access for administrators and sales personnel, making it a secure and 
efficient tool for day-to-day operations.

The application features advanced reporting capabilities, generating professional PDF reports using 
the wkhtmltopdf library. It also simplifies database management through tools like SQLite DB Browser 
for local database viewing and XAMPP phpMyAdmin for managing MySQL databases. With its modular design 
and interactive user interface, SPMS offers an intuitive and user-friendly experience for both 
technical and non-technical users.
